This repo was created on November 6th 2020, just after the presidential election during a period in which there were widespread conspiracy theories centered on the absentee ballots which skewed towards one candidate.

Online, often bandied about was a list of 16,000 registered voters in Michigan over the age of 100, touted as evidence of fraud as there aren't that many centenarian in the state, and clearly their presence on the voter roles was evidence of abuse through the absentee ballots, with votes being illegally cast under the stolen identies of  dead people. 

To debunk this claim, and get some practice in using asyncio, a script was written to go through this list and find the matching entries on the Michigan registration-checking site, and check the statuses of the absentee ballots if any had been requested.

As expected, this list of 16,000 people had only 1,300 actually requesting absentee ballots. Most of these were right on 
the age of 100, with the expected increasing falloff with each passing year. 

Googling those who did request ballots, I didn't find any obituaries like the conspiracy would alledge, more often than not when there were any approriate matches for the 
person it was interesting interviews with some of our oldest citizens, who are still being active in their communities and civic duties
even after 100 years.
